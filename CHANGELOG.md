### Changed

- Moved source in subfolders per categories (File/Folders, User/Groups).
- Testing using Git Tools task (the new GitVersion).

### Fixed

- Fixed the main branch to release from to be `main` instead of `master`.
- Removing the 'Configure winrm' tasks (as we're only running on linux).
- Added the DocGenerator tasks to build.yaml.
- Fixed casing to `nxtools` because I can't change PSGallery package casing.
- Removing dupplicate files.
