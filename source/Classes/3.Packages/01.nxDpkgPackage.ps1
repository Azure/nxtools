    # This field identifies the source package name.
    $Source

    # The package maintainer’s name and email address.
    # The name must come first, then the email address inside angle brackets <> (in RFC822 format).
    $Maintainer

    # List of the names and email addresses of co-maintainers of the package, if any.
    $Uploaders

    # The name and email address of the person who prepared this version of the package,
    # usually a maintainer. The syntax is the same as for the Maintainer field.

    $Section

    # This field represents how important it is that the user have the package installed.
    # See Priorities.
    $Priority

    # Depending on context and the control file used, the Architecture field can include the following sets of values:
    #  - A unique single word identifying a Debian machine architecture as described in Architecture specification strings.
    #    (https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-customized-programs.html#s-arch-spec)
    #  - An architecture wildcard identifying a set of Debian machine architectures, see Architecture wildcards.
    #    (https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-customized-programs.html#s-arch-wildcard-spec)
    #    `any` matches all Debian machine architectures and is the most frequently used.
    #  - all, which indicates an architecture-independent package.
    #  - source, which indicates a source package.
    $Architecture

    # This is a boolean field which may occur only in the control file of a binary package or
    # in a per-package fields paragraph of a source package control file.
    # If set to yes then the package management system will refuse to remove the package
    # (upgrading and replacing it is still possible).
    # The other possible value is no, which is the same as not having the field at all.
